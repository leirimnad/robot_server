## Robot Control Server

Robot Control Server is a server application for guiding robots on a simplified map. \
The process of controlling the robot consists of authentication and guiding the robot to the `(0, 0)` coordinate. \
The application starts a separate thread for each robot. \
The application also contains a GUI for displaying the conversation and the map for each robot.in real time.

This application is a semester project for the course "Python Programming" at FIT CTU in Prague. \
Full assignment is available [here](./task.md).

  PORT                  number of port to listen on

options:
  -a A.A.A.A, --host A.A.A.A
                        host IP address to listen on
  -g, --gui             run with GUI

</pre>

### Running tests

**Run all tests:**
```bash
pytest
```
or
```bash
python -m pytest
```

**Run tests with coverage:**
```bash
coverage run -m pytest ; coverage report
```
or 
```bash
python -m coverage run -m pytest ; python -m coverage report
```

#### Binary tests

Apart from unit tests, there are also binary tests created by the teacher for evaluating the application. \
Instructions for running them are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bee4uq4iLhO9HYoCxRXQksOJaKFc2dxq/view?usp=sharing) (in Czech) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-agqvlpSXdkOIe9Anw9rd0mqRvn7r-q/view?usp=sharing) (in English).

Windows users should download the VirtualBox image for running the binary tests. \
The instructions for that are available on links above.

The binary file for the Linux users is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QzPyzZeLNWZhjtbaTGehyNu-zgHcInta). \
The instructions for running the binary tests on Linux are available [in the task description](./task.md#tester). \
In short: ```tester <port number> <remote address> [test number(s)]```

### Known issues

Tested on Windows 11 with Python 3.11 and Lubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.10.

- When running on Linux, GraphicsView might not display the map properly. \
  Map is displayed properly when the window is scrolled. \
  Presumably, the issue is caused by Qt library.
