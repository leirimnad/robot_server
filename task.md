# Robot Control Server - Task

## Annotation

This is the task description that was downloaded from the CTU FIT course website. \
The original file is available for CTU students and employees [here in Czech](https://courses.fit.cvut.cz/BI-PSI/homework/index.html) and [here in English](https://courses.fit.cvut.cz/BIE-PSI/homework.html).

The task is to create multithreaded server for TCP/IP communication and implement communication protocol according to
the specification. Note, the implementation of the client part is not a part of this task. See the section [Testing](#testing).

Short instruction video for testing and quick start with the task: [homework-intro+testing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-agqvlpSXdkOIe9Anw9rd0mqRvn7r-q/view?usp=sharing).

The server doesn't have to be implemented with threads, you can use processes or any other techniques, which allow the
server to handle multiple clients in the same time.

## Task

Create a server for automatic control of remote robots. Robots authenticate to the server and server directs them to
origin of the coordinate system. For testing purposes each robot starts at the random coordinates and its target
location is always located on the coordinate [0,0]. The robot should reach that target coordinate and pick the secret
message, which can be found only on that spot. Server is able to navigate several robots at once and implements
communication protocol without errors.

## Detailed specification

Communication between server and robots is implemented via a pure textual protocol. Each command ends with a pair of
special symbols "\a\b". Server must follow the communication protocol strictly, but should take into account imperfect
robots firmware (see section Special situations).

### Server messages:

| Name                          | Message                                 | Description                                                                                       |

Time constants:

| Name               | Value \[s] | Description                                                                     | 
|--------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TIMEOUT            | 1          | Server and client wait for the answer from the other side during this interval. | 
| TIMEOUT_RECHARGING | 5          | Time interval, during which robot has to finish recharging.                     | 

Communication with robots could be divided into several phases:

### Authentication

Server and client both know five pairs of authentication keys (these are not public and private keys):

| Key ID | Server Key | Client Key | 
|--------|------------|------------|
| 0      | 23019      | 32037      | 
| 1      | 32037      | 29295      | 
| 2      | 18789      | 13603      | 
| 3      | 16443      | 29533      | 
| 4      | 18189      | 21952      | 

Each robot starts communication with sending its username (CLIENT_USERNAME message). Username can be any sequence of up
to 18 characters not containing the termination sequence "\a\b". In the next step the server asks the client for sending
Key ID (SERVER_KEY_ID_REQUEST message), which is in fact an id of the server and client keys, which the client wants to
use for authentication. The client answers by sending Key ID (CLIENT_KEY_ID message). After these steps the server knows
the correct key pair, and it can calculate "hash" code from the username of the client by the following formula:

<pre>
Username: Meow!

ASCII representation: 77 101 111 119 33

Resulting hash: ((77 + 101 + 111 + 119 + 33) * 1000) % 65536 = 47784 
</pre>

Resulting hash is 16-bit number in decimal notation. The server then adds a server key to the hash, so that if 16-bit
capacity is exceeded, the value simply "wraps around" (due to modulo operation):

<pre>(47784 + 54621) % 65536 = 36869</pre>

Resulting confirmation code of server is sent to client as text in SERVER_CONFIRM message. Client takes the received
code and calculates hash back from it, then compares it with the expected hash value, which he has calculated from the
username. If they are equal, client computes the confirmation code of client and sends it back to the server.
Calculation of the client confirmation code is simular to the server one, only the client key is used:

<pre>(47784 + 45328) % 65536 = 27576</pre>

Client confirmation key is sent to the server in CLIENT_CONFIRMATION message, server calculates hash back from it and
compares it with the original hash of the username. If values are equal, server sends message SERVER_OK, otherwise
answers with message SERVER_LOGIN_FAILED and terminates the connection. The whole sequence of steps is represented at
the following picture:

<pre>
Client                  Server
â€‹------------------------------------------
CLIENT_USERNAME     --->
                    <---    SERVER_KEY_REQUEST
CLIENT_KEY_ID       --->
                    <---    SERVER_CONFIRMATION
CLIENT_CONFIRMATION --->
                    <---    SERVER_OK
                              or
                            SERVER_LOGIN_FAILED
                      .
                      .
                      .
</pre>

Server does not know usernames in advance. Robots can choose any name, but they have to know the list of client and
server keys. The key pair ensures two-sided authentication and prevents the authentication process from being compromised
by simple eavesdropping of communication.

### Movement of robot to the target coordinates

Robot can move only straight (SERVER_MOVE), but is able to turn right (SERVER_TURN_RIGHT) or left (SERVER_TURN_LEFT).
After each move command robot sends confirmation (CLIENT_OK), part of which is actual coordinates of robot. At the
beginning of communication robot position is not known to server. Server must find out robot position and orientation (
direction) only from robot answers. In order to prevent infinite wandering of robot in space, each robot has a limited
number of movements (move forward). The number of turns is not limited. The number of moves should be sufficient for a
reasonable robot transfer to the target. Following is a demonstration of communication. The server first moves the robot
twice to detect its current state and then guides it towards the target coordinate [0,0].

<pre>
Client                  Server
â€‹------------------------------------------
                  .
                  .
                  .
                <---    SERVER_MOVE
                          or
                        SERVER_TURN_LEFT
                          or
                        SERVER_TURN_RIGHT
CLIENT_CONFIRM  --->
                <---    SERVER_MOVE
                          or
                        SERVER_TURN_LEFT
                          or
                        SERVER_TURN_RIGHT
CLIENT_CONFIRM  --->
                <---    SERVER_MOVE
                          or
                        SERVER_TURN_LEFT
                          or
                        SERVER_TURN_RIGHT
                  .
                  .
                  .
</pre>

This part of communication cannot be skipped, robot waits at least one of the movement commands - SERVER_MOVE,
SERVER_TURN_LEFT or SERVER_TURN_RIGHT. There is several obstacles on the way to the target coordinate, which must be
bypassed by the robots. The obstacle placement follows these rules:

- The obstacle spans only a single pair of coordinates.
- All neighbouring coordinates around the obstacle are always free, therefore the obstacle can be always bypassed.
- The obstacle is never placed on the target coordinates [0,0].
- If the robot crushes an obstacle (any obstacle) more than 20 times, it breaks down and ends the connection.

The obstacle is detected by the fact that robot doesn't change its position after SERVER_MOVE command (the CLIENT_OK
message contains the same coordinate as it was in the previous step). If the robot doesn't move, the number of remaining
moves is not decreased, but the number of remaining crashes is decreased by one.

### Secret message discovery

After the robot reaches the target coordinate [0,0], it attempts to pick up the secret message (SERVER_PICK_UP). If robot
receives command to pick up the secret message, but robot is not in the target coordinate [0,0], an auto-destruction of
robot is initiated and communication with server is abrupted. After the robot picks the secret message, it sends to the
server CLIENT_MESSAGE with the secret. The server has to answer with SERVER_LOGOUT. (It is guaranteed, that secret
message never matches the message CLIENT_RECHARGING, so if the recharge message is obtained by the server after the "pick
up" command, it always means that robot started to charge.) After that, client and server close the connection. Demo of
the secret message picking:

<pre>
Client                  Server
â€‹------------------------------------------
                  .
                  .
                  .
                <---    SERVER_PICK_UP
CLIENT_MESSAGE  --->
                <---    SERVER_LOGOUT
</pre>

### Recharging

Each robot has a limited power source. If it starts to run out of battery, he notifies the server and then recharges
itself from the solar panel. It does not respond to any messages during the charging. When it finishes, it informs the
server and continues there, where it left before recharging. If the robot does not stop charging in the time interval
TIMEOUT_RECHARGING, the server terminates the connection.

<pre>
Client                    Server
â€‹------------------------------------------
CLIENT_USERNAME   --->
                  <---    SERVER_CONFIRMATION
CLIENT_RECHARGING --->

      ...

CLIENT_FULL_POWER --->
CLIENT_OK         --->
                  <---    SERVER_OK
                            or
                          SERVER_LOGIN_FAILED
                    .
                    .
                    .
</pre>

Another example:

<pre>
Client                  Server
â€‹------------------------------------------
                    .
                    .
                    .
                  <---    SERVER_MOVE
CLIENT_OK         --->
CLIENT_RECHARGING --->

      ...

CLIENT_FULL_POWER --->
                  <---    SERVER_MOVE
CLIENT_OK         --->
                  .
                  .
                  .
</pre>

## Error situations

Some robots can have corrupted firmware and thus communicate wrongly. Server should detect misbehavior and react
correctly.

### Error during authentication

If the CLIENT_KEY_ID message contains the id outside the expected range (which is an integer value between 0 and 4),
the server sends the SERVER_KEY_OUT_OF_RANGE_ERROR and closes the connection. For simplification of the implementation
process the CLIENT_KEY_ID can contain even negative numbers (it doesn't make sense in the context of this protocol). If
the CLIENT_KEY_ID message contains something else than integer values (for example letters), the server sends
SERVER_SYNTAX_ERROR message and closes the connection.

If the CLIENT_CONFIRMATION message contains the incorrect value (even the negative value), the server sends
SERVER_LOGIN_FAILED message and closes the connection. If the CLIENT_CONFIRMATION contains anything else than numeric
value, the server reacts with SERVER_SYNTAX_ERROR message and closes the connection.

### Syntax error
The server always reacts to the syntax error immediately after receiving the message in which it detected the error. The
server sends the SERVER_SYNTAX_ERROR message to the robot and then terminates the connection as soon as possible.
Syntactically incorrect messages:

- Incoming message is longer than number of characters defined for each message (including the termination sequence
\a\b). Message length is defined in client messages table.
- Incoming message syntax does not correspond to any of messages CLIENT_USERNAME, CLIENT_KEY_ID, CLIENT_CONFIRMATION,
CLIENT_OK, CLIENT_RECHARGING and CLIENT_FULL_POWER.

Each incoming message is tested for the maximal size and only messages CLIENT_CONFIRMATION, CLIENT_OK,
CLIENT_RECHARGING and CLIENT_FULL_POWER are tested for their content (messages CLIENT_USERNAME and CLIENT_MESSAGE can
contain anything).

### Logic error
Logic error happens only during the recharging - when robot sends information about charging (CLIENT_RECHARGING) and
then sends anything other than CLIENT_FULL_POWER, or it sends CLIENT_FULL_POWER without sending CLIENT_RECHARGING before.
Server reacts to these situations with SERVER_LOGIC_ERROR message and immediate termination of connection.

### Timeout
Protokol for communication with robots contains two timeout types:

- TIMEOUT - timeout for communication. If robot or server does not receive message from the other side for this time
interval, they consider the connection to be lost and immediately terminate it.
- TIMEOUT_RECHARGING - timeout for robot charging. After the server receives message CLIENT_RECHARGING, robot should at
latest till this interval send message CLIENT_FULL_POWER. If robot does not manage it, server has to immediately
terminate the connection.

### Special situations

During the communication through some complicated network infrastructure two situations can take place:

- Message can arrive divided into several parts, which are read from the socket one at a time. (This happens due to
segmentation and possible delay of some segments on the way through the network.)
- Message, sent shortly after another one, may arrive almost simultaneously with it. They could be read together with one
reading from the socket. (This happens, when the server does not manage to read the first message from the buffer before
the second message arrives.)

Using a direct connection between the server and the robots, combined with powerful hardware, these situations cannot
occur naturally, so they are artificially created by the tester. In some tests, both situations are combined.

Every properly implemented server should be able to cope with this situation. Firmware of robots counts on this fact and
even exploits it. If there are situations in the protocol where messages from the robot have a predetermined order, they
are sent in that order at once. This allows robots to reduce their power consumption and simplifies protocol
implementation (from their point of view).

## Server optimization

Server optimizes the protokol, so it does not wait for the end of the message, which is obviously bad. For example, only a
part of the username message is sent for authentication. Server for example receives 22 characters of the username, but
still does not receive the termination sequence \a\b. Since the maximum username message length is 20 characters, it is
clear that the message received cannot be valid. Therefore, the server does not wait for the rest of the message, but
sends a message SERVER_SYNTAX_ERROR and terminates the connection. In principle, server should react in the same way
when receiving a secret message.

In the part of communication where robot is navigated to the target coordinates, server expects three possible messages:
CLIENT_OK, CLIENT_RECHARGING, or CLIENT_FULL_POWER. If server reads a part of the incomplete message and this part is
longer than the maximum length of these messages, it sends SERVER_SYNTAX_ERROR and terminates the connection. For the
help with optimization, the maximum length for each message is listed in the table.

## Demo communication

```text
C: "Oompa Loompa\a\b"
S: "107 KEY REQUEST\a\b"
C: "0\a\b"
S: "64907\a\b"
C: "8389\a\b"
S: "200 OK\a\b"
S: "102 MOVE\a\b"
C: "OK 0 0\a\b"
S: "102 MOVE\a\b"
C: "OK -1 0\a\b"
S: "104 TURN RIGHT\a\b"
C: "OK -1 0\a\b"
S: "104 TURN RIGHT\a\b"
C: "OK -1 0\a\b"
S: "102 MOVE\a\b"
C: "OK 0 0\a\b"
S: "105 GET MESSAGE\a\b"
C: "Secret message.\a\b"
S: "106 LOGOUT\a\b"
```

## Testing
Image of OS Tiny Core Linux is prepared for your server testing. It contains tester of the homework. Image is
compatible with VirtualBox application.

### Tester
Download and unzip the image. Then run the image in VirtualBox. After starting and booting shell is immediately ready to
use. Tester is run by command tester:

``` 
tester <port number> <remote address> [test number(s)]
```

The first parameter is the port number on which your server will listen. The following is a parameter with the server
remote address. If your server is running on the same computer as VirtualBox, use the default gateway address.

The output is quite long, so it is good to redirect it to the less command, in which it is easier to navigate.

If no test number is entered, all tests are run sequentially. Tests can also be run individually. The following example
runs tests 2, 3, and 8:

```tester 3999 10.0.2.2 2 3 8 | less```

### Possible problems in OS Windows and Mac
In some Windows or macOS installations, there is a problem with standard configuration of virtual machine. If the
tester in virtual machine cannot connect to the tested server in the host operating system, follow these steps:

- Additional step for macOS only, as Host-only Adapters in VirtualBox on do not work right out of the box: creating a
Host-only Network in VirtualBox (File â†’ Host Network Manager: "Create" button).
- When virtual machine with tester is off, change its network adapter settings from NAT to Host-only network (Host-only
Adapter). In MacOS, select "vboxnet0" under the "name" drop down list.
- The network interface belonging to VirtualBox should appear in the host OS. This can be found from the command line with
the ipconfig command. The IP address of this interface is likely to be 192.168.56.1/24.
- Now you need to manually set the IP address of eth0 network interface in the virtual machine with tester:
```sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.56.2 netmask 255.255.255.0```
- Now you can start the tester but as the destination address enter the IP address of the network interface in the host
OS:
```tester 3999 192.168.56.1```
- Do not forget to use that address in your server.

The directory from the previous link contains directories with the various versions of the tester. Each directory has
the version vX (where X is the number of the version). If you want to understand all secret messages, use the english
version vX-EN. Always download the version with the greatest number X. Each directory consists of the following files:

- BI-PSI_tester_2023_vX-EN.ova - OS image with tester as a virtual machine for VirtualBox
- psi-tester-2023-vX-EN_x64.bz2 - Binary program of tester for linux (64-bit version)
- psi-tester-2023-vX-EN_x86.bz2 - Binary program of tester for linux
- psi-tester-2023-vX-EN_arm.bz2 - Binary program of tester for the ARM architecture

Users of Apple MacBook with the processor M1 have a slightly complicated testing process. The Apple company makes the
creations of C++ applications much harder, if you don't work in Apple operating system. No one in our team poses the
target laptop, hence we cannot simply create and test the tester for that architecture. In order to run it, you need to
install the VirtualBox from the link above (the preview version should work fine) and install any linux distribution for
ARM architecture. The tester should work in that operating system just fine. The Debian distribution should do the
trick:

[Debian install iso for arm64](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/arm64/iso-cd/debian-11.6.0-arm64-netinst.iso)
